Exhibitionist
=============
Not afraid to show off a little

Exhibitionist is set to be a `Node.js`_ application for serving presentations.
It runs on your local machine, opening up ports for the presentation,
interaction from the audience, and controlling the presentation.

.. Warning::
    Everything about this application is in constant flux, so proceed with
    caution.  As I write this warning, there's yet to be any code committed, so
    pretty much nothing here works.  This document is meant as road map.
