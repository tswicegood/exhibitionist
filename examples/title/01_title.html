            This is the presentation that outlines what <a
                href="http://github.com/tswicegood/exhibitionist">Exhibitionist</a>
            is all about.  It's a dogfood example.  If you're reading this, you're
            either looking at the source, or you're the presenter.

            Either way, get ready for an exhibit in coolness.
